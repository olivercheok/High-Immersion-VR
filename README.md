# Rube Goldberg Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.4.15
Oliver Cheok
Using:
SteamVR 1.1.4
Unity 2017.4.15f1 (64-bit)

Time it took me: 3 weeks
One thing I like about the project is that I get use my creativity in developing my levels. 
The most challenging thing i found about this project is to get my keybindings working on my Oculus Touch.
I noticed that SteamVR content in this course is outdated and we don't have good guides on getting the Oculus Touch working.

I used Oculus Rift + Touch to test and develop my project
Thank you for your time!
